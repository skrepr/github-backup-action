# Review when someone opens a pull request.
# Change this to the users that are responsible for this repository. For example the lead developer
* @jeroenvandermeulen

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# Change in .github can affect the way the repo is managed. Because of this, Team Infra needs to review the changes
.github/ @skrepr/infra
